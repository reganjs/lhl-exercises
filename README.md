# lhl-exercises

This repository includes various exercises that I completed during my time at Lighthouse Labs. The exercises were not required to be included on my Github Profile but I wanted to document all of my work within the program for future reference. The exercises will be completed using various languages and tools and include comments in each explaining my work. This will be updated regularly until I complete the course.
